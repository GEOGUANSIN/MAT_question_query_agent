0,A,"The function $p(x)=x^{3}$ is an example of a polynomial with the property that there is a point on the graph $y=p(x)$ with zero derivative which is neither a local maximum nor a local minimum. Which one of the following polynomials has the same property?

(a) $y=x^{3}-3 x^{2}+x$
(b) $y=x^{3}-3 x^{2}+2 x$
(c) $y=x^{3}-3 x^{2}+3 x$
(d) $y=x^{3}-3 x^{2}+4 x$
(e) $y=x^{3}-3 x^{2}+5 x$"," Each of the given polynomials is of the form $y=x^{3}-3 x^{2}+k x$. The first derivative is $3 x^{2}-6 x+k$, and the second derivative is $6 x-6$. So if there is a point with zero derivative, then it will either be a local maximum or a local minimum, unless $x=1$. At $x=1$ the first derivative is $k-3$, which is only zero if $k=3$.

1,B,"Which of the following numbers is the smallest?

(a) $\log _{10}\left(\sqrt[10]{10^{11}}\right)$
(b) $\frac{\pi}{2}$
(c) $\frac{11}{9}$
(d) $\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}$
(e) $\sqrt{3} \cos \left(44^{\circ}\right)$"," Note that $\sqrt[10]{10^{11}}$ is $10^{11 / 10}$, so $\log _{10}\left(\sqrt[10]{10^{11}}\right)=\frac{11}{10}$. This is less than $\frac{11}{9}$.

To compare $\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}$ with $\frac{11}{10}$, compare their squares; compare $\frac{3}{2}$ with $\frac{121}{100}$. The former is $\frac{150}{100}$ which is larger than $\frac{121}{100}$.
Now note that $\sqrt{3} \cos \left(44^{\circ}\right)$ is slightly larger than $\sqrt{3} \cos \left(45^{\circ}\right)$ which is $\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}$.
Finally note that $\pi>3$ so $\frac{\pi}{2}>\frac{3}{2}>\frac{11}{10}$.
So the smallest of the numbers is $\frac{11}{10}$.

3,D,"All even square numbers are multiples of 4. All odd square numbers are one more than a multiple of 4 . It follows that the number of positive integer solutions $(x, y)$ to the equation

$$
x^{2}+3 y^{2}=4442
$$
is
(a) 0
(b) 1
(c) 2
(d) 3
(e) 4442"," The numbers $x$ and $y$ are each either odd or even, so the squares $x^{2}$ and $y^{2}$ are each either multiples of 4 or one more than a multiple of 4 . There are four cases to check, and after checking each, we find that the expression on the left-hand side could be a multiple of 4 (if $x$ and $y$ are both even, or both odd), or could be one more than a multiple of 4 (if $x$ is odd and $y$ is even), or could be three more than a multiple of 4 (if $x$ is even and $y$ is odd). The number on the right-hand side is two more than a multiple of 4 . So there are no solutions.

4,E,"Let $d(n)$ be the number of digits in a positive integer $n$ (with $n$ written in the usual decimal notation). For example $d(2)=1, d(103)=3$, and $d\left(10^{6}\right)=7$.

(a) $\frac{1}{2}$

(c) $\frac{9}{10}$
(d) 1
(e) $\frac{9}{5}$"," Starting with 1, there are nine one-digit numbers. Then from 11 to 99 there are 90 two-digit numbers, then there are 900 three-digit numbers, and so on. So the required sum is (grouping terms by the number of digits of $n$ ) equal to

$$
9 \times 20^{-1}+90 \times 20^{-2}+900 \times 20^{-3}+\ldots

5,F,"For two vectors $\left(\begin{array}{l}a \\ b\end{array}\right)$ and $\left(\begin{array}{l}c \\ d\end{array}\right)$ with integer components (positive or negative or zero), we define the function

(a) 0
(b) 1
(c) 2
(d) 3
(e) Infinitely many"," If $a=c$ and $b=d$ then the expression we're given for $f\left(\left(\begin{array}{l}a \\ b\end{array}\right),\left(\begin{array}{l}c \\ d\end{array}\right)\right)$ becomes $\left(\begin{array}{c}a^{2}+b^{2} \\ 2 a b+b^{2}\end{array}\right)$.

We're looking for whole numbers (positive or negative or zero) for $a$ and $b$ such that $a^{2}+b^{2}=2$ and $2 a b+2 b^{2}=0$. From the second equation we conclude that $b=0$ or $a+b=0$. If $b=0$ then $a^{2}=2$ but there are no whole numbers that square to 2 . If $a+b=0$ then we can eliminate $b$ from the first equation and conclude that $a= \pm 1$. We should check that $\left(\begin{array}{c}1 \\ -1\end{array}\right)$ and $\left(\begin{array}{c}-1 \\ 1\end{array}\right)$ both work.

6,G,"For a pair of integers $x$ and $y$ with $x \geq 0$ and $y>0$, we define

$$
f(x, y)=\frac{1}{2}(x+y)(x+y+1)+y

What is the set of possible values that $f(x, y)$ can take?
(a) All positive integers.
(b) All positive even integers.
(c) All positive integers except for odd prime numbers.
(d) All positive integers that are triangular numbers (those which are the sum of the first $k$ positive integers for some $k \geq 1$ ).
(e) All positive integers except for the triangular numbers."," The triangular numbers described in the question as the sum of the first $k$ positive integers for some $k \geq 1$ have the form $\frac{1}{2} k(k+1)$, if we sum the arithmetic series.

Let's write $N=x+y$. Then $0<y \leq N$ and $f=\frac{1}{2} N(N+1)+y$. In words, first we choose a triangular number and then we add some positive quantity $y$. The number $y$ can never be quite large enough to make the ""next"" triangular number because the difference between $\frac{1}{2} N(N+1)$ and $\frac{1}{2}(N+1)(N+2)$ is $N+1$. But $f$ can take all other values.

7,H,"Let $p(x)=2 x^{4}-3 x^{3}-5 x^{2}+2 x+2$. Given that the $y=m x$, with $m$ a real number, crosses the curve $y=p(x)$ at four distinct points, let the $x$-coordinates of those points be $x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}$, and $x_{4}$. The product $x_{1} x_{2} x_{3} x_{4}$ is equal to

(a) 0
(b) 1
(c) 2
(d) 3
(e) Not enough information"," We're told that $2 x^{4}-3 x^{3}-5 x^{2}+2 x+2=m x$ has exactly four real solutions $x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, x_{4}$. Moving the $m x$ to the other side of the equation, the Factor Theorem implies that the resulting polynomial factorises like this;

$$
2 x^{4}-3 x^{3}-5 x^{2}+(2-m) x+2=2\left(x-x_{1}\right)\left(x-x_{2}\right)\left(x-x_{3}\right)\left(x-x_{4}\right),
$$
where we have been careful to include the factor of 2 in order to match the leading coefficient of $x$. Now subsitute $x=0$ in both sides of the equation for the result that $2=2 x_{1} x_{2} x_{3} x_{4}$.

8,I,"Consider the nine lines $y=2 x+1, y=2 x+2, \ldots, y=2 x+9$ and the seven lines $y=-x+1, y=-x+2, \ldots, y=-x+7$.

How many distinct points are there at which the line $y=1-10 x$ crosses one or more of the other lines?
(a) 12
(b) 13
(c) 14
(d) 15
(e) 16"," The equations describe grid of parallel lines, with the line $y=1-10 x$ crossing opposite corners and the midpoint of the grid, but no other grid points.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2024_03_31_e665606340d23fab60a7g-2}
\end{center}
There would normally be 16 points where the line $y=1-10 x$ crosses 16 given lines, but at three grid points the line $y=1-10 x$ crosses two of the given lines ""simultaneously"". There are only 13 distinct points where the line $y=1-10 x$ crosses one or more of the other lines.
The answer is (b)
$\mathbf{J}$ The equation rearranges to
$$
x^{4}+4 x^{3} y+6 x^{2} y^{2}+4 x y^{3}+y^{4}=x^{2}
$$
If we recognise the left-hand side as $(x+y)^{4}$ then we can simplify this down to $(x+y)^{4}=x^{2}$. Now if $x$ is positive then $(x+y)^{2}=x$ and so $y=-x \pm \sqrt{x}$. Since $x$ grows faster than $\sqrt{x}$, the value of $y$ is eventually negative for both of these solutions (once $x>1$ ). Only one of the graphs behaves like this.
