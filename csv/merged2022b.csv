0,A,"Whenever I toss a particular coin, it lands on heads with probability $\cos ^{2} \alpha$ for some fixed real number $\alpha$ (and the outcome is independent of other tosses). I toss the coin three times. The probability that the coin lands on heads two or more times is equal to

(a) $1+3 \sin ^{4} \alpha-2 \sin ^{6} \alpha$,
(b) $1-3 \sin ^{4} \alpha-2 \sin ^{6} \alpha$,
(c) $1+3 \sin ^{4} \alpha+2 \sin ^{6} \alpha$,
(d) $1-3 \sin ^{4} \alpha+2 \sin ^{6} \alpha$,
(e) $1+8 \sin ^{6} \alpha$."," Note that the probability that the coin does not land on heads is $1-\cos ^{2} \alpha=\sin ^{2} \alpha$. The probability of exactly two heads is $\left(\begin{array}{l}3 \\ 2\end{array}\right) \cos ^{4} \alpha \sin ^{2} \alpha$ and the probability of exactly three heads is $\left(\begin{array}{l}3 \\ 1\end{array}\right) \cos ^{6} \alpha$. Simplifying gives

$$
3 \cos ^{4} \alpha \sin ^{2} \alpha+\cos ^{6} \alpha=3\left(1-\sin ^{2} \alpha\right)^{2} \sin ^{2} \alpha+\left(1-\sin ^{2} \alpha\right)^{3}=1-3 \sin ^{4} \alpha+2 \sin ^{6} \alpha

Now as $x$ varies from 0 to $\infty, u$ will decay exponentially from 1 to 0 . Along the way, $u-u^{2}$ will start at 0 , then vary through positive numbers, first increasing for $u>1 / 2$ then decreasing for $u<1 / 2$ and eventually tending towards 0 .

When are the two sides equal? That happens when $x=1$ or when $x(x-2)=1$, that is when $x=1 \pm \sqrt{2}$. Note that one of these roots is negative and the other is positive.

The intersection points between the inner circle and those lines are $(\sqrt{3} / 2,1 / 2)$ and reflections, so the acute angle subtended at the origin by the two lines is $60^{\circ}$. We would therefore like one-third of the area between the two circles, which is $\frac{1}{3} \pi\left(2^{2}-1^{2}\right)=\pi$.
The answer is (b)
$\mathbf{E}$ The centre of the circle is $\left(\frac{p}{2}, \frac{q+1}{2}\right)$ and the radius is $\sqrt{\frac{p^{2}}{4}+\frac{(q-1)^{2}}{4}}$, so the equation of the circle is

6,G,"Given that $y=f(x)$ is a solution to $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=y^{1 / 4}$, it follows that one of the following functions is a solution to $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=2 y^{1 / 4}$. Which one?

(a) $y=(2)^{-4} f(x)$,
(b) $y=(2)^{3} f(x)$,
(c) $y=(2)^{4 / 3} f(x)$,
(d) $y=(2)^{-3} f(x)$,
(e) $y=(2)^{4} f(x)$."," Clearly $f$ is always a positive whole integer from the recursion relations.

First find $n$ with $f(n)=1$. Because $f(2 n)=f(n)$ and $f(1)=1$, it must be the case that for all powers of $2, f(n)=1$. On the other hand, $f(2 n+1)=f(n)+f(n+1)$ is definitely at least two, so $f(n)$ is only equal to 1 on the powers of 2 .
Next consider values of $n$ for which $f(n)=2$. The first equation shows us that if we have $n$ even and $f(n)=2$ then $f(n / 2)=2$. Let's suppose instead that $n$ is odd and write $n=2 m+1$. Then we would have $f(n)=f(m)+f(m+1)$. The only way for this to be 2 is if the right-hand side is $1+1$, which only happens if both the consecutive numbers $m, m+1$ are powers of 2 , which only happens for 1,2 . Check that $f(3)=f(1)+f(2)=2$. So the points where $f(n)=2$ are precisely those where $n$ is three times a power of 2 (they're of the form $3 \times 2^{k}$ ).
Now finally consider values of $n$ for which $f(n)=3$. The first equation again tells us that we can multiply any such $n$ by 2 . Let's look for odd solutions. They must come from $1+2$ on the right-hand side of the second equation, which only happens if a power of $2\left(2^{l}\right.$ say) is one more or one less than a number of the form $3 \times 2^{k}$. That's a bit unusual though, because both $2^{l}$\\
and $3 \times 2^{k}$ are even, unless one of the powers of 2 is equal to 1 . So those consecutive numbers must be either 2 and 3 or they could be 3 and 4 . This gives $f(5)=3$ and $f(7)=3$, but that's it for odd numbers. The solutions to $f(n)=3$ are therefore $5 \times 2^{k}$ or $7 \times 2^{k}$. None of these are multiples of 35 .

The right-hand side is a line with gradient $2^{b}$ and $y$-intercept $a 2^{b}$. We're looking for positive solutions, and there are two ways this could happen; either $a 2^{b}$ is larger than zero, but the line grows slower than $x$, or $a 2^{b}$ is negative but the line grows faster than $x$. This corresponds to (in the first case) $a>0$ and $b<0$, or (in the second case) $a<0$ and $b>0$. Either way, $a b<0$. There's only one intersection between two straight lines, if any.
