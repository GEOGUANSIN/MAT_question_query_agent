0,A,"The distance between opposite corners of a cube is 2 . The surface area of the cube equals\\

(a) 4 ,\\
(b) 6 ,\\
(c) 8 ,\\
(d) 12 ,\\
(e) 24 ."," If the side length of the cube is $x$, then the distance between opposite corners is $x \sqrt{3}$. So here $x=2 / \sqrt{3}$ and the surface area is $6 x^{2}=8$

The answer is (c)",2020b
1,B,"If $x$ is a very large positive real number, then the product

$$
2^{x} \times 3^{-x} \times 4^{x} \times 5^{-x} \times \cdots \times 18^{x} \times 19^{-x} \times 20^{x} \times 21^{-x}
$$

(a) very close to zero,
(b) slightly larger than 1 ,
(c) equal to 1 ,
(d) very close to 2 ,
(e) very large."," Pair the terms for $(2 / 3)^{x}(4 / 5)^{x} \ldots(20 / 21)^{x}$. Each of these terms gets very small for large $x$, so the product gets close to zero.

2,C,"Using degrees, the number of real solutions $x$ to the equation

$$
\cos \left(\frac{240 x}{x^{2}+4}\right)=\frac{1}{2}
$$
is\\
(a) 0 ,\\
(b) 1 ,\\
(c) 2 ,\\
(d) 3 ,\\
(e) infinite."," Must have

$$
\frac{240 x}{x^{2}+4}=360 n \pm 60
$$
for some whole number $n$. So
$$
4 x=(6 n \pm 1)\left(x^{2}+4\right)
$$
SO
$$
x^{2}-\frac{4}{6 n \pm 1} x+4=0
$$
Now if $n=0$ we get solutions $x=2$ and $x=-2$. If $n \neq 0$ then the discriminant of this quadratic $\frac{16}{(6 n \pm 1)^{2}}-16$ is negative, so no other solutions. So two solutions.

3,D,"Let

$$
y=2 x+3 x^{2}+5 x^{3}+\ldots
$$
so that the coefficient of $x^{n}$ is the $n^{\text {th }}$ prime number. Then the value of $\frac{\mathrm{d}^{5} y}{\mathrm{~d} x^{5}}$ at $x=0$ is\\
(a) 0 ,\\
(b) 120,\\
(c) 840 ,\\
(d) 1080,\\
(e) 1320 ."," The next few terms are

$$
y=2 x+3 x^{2}+5 x^{3}+7 x^{4}+11 x^{5}+13 x^{6}
$$
Only the $x^{5}$ term contributes to the value of the fifth derivative at $x=0$ (higher terms are zero because they include $x^{n-5}$ and lower powers give zero when differentiated five times). We get $5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 \times 11=1320$

5,F,"The following are statements about a real number $x$.

Then it follows that
(a) $P$ implies $Q$ but $Q$ does not imply $P$.
(b) $Q$ implies $P$ but $P$ does not imply $Q$.
(c) $P$ and $Q$ are equivalent.
(d) If $P$ is true then $Q$ is false.
(e) If $Q$ is true then $P$ is false."," Statement $P$ is equivalent to "" $-1<x<1$ or $x<-2$ "". Statement $Q$ is equivalent to "" $-1<$ $x<1$ "". So $Q$ implies $P$ but $P$ does not imply $Q$.

6,G,"The functions $S$ and $T$ are defined by

$$
S(x)=x+1, \quad T(x)=\frac{1}{2} x-1 .

Beginning with $x=0$ the functions $S$ and $T$ are repeatedly applied in some order. For example, $\operatorname{SST} S(0)=\frac{3}{2}$. The set of possible outputs is
(a) all positive rational numbers.
(b) all rational numbers greater than -1 with denominator a power of 2 when written in lowest terms.
(c) all rational numbers with denominator a power of 2 when written in lowest terms.
(d) all positive rational numbers with denominator a power of 2 when written in lowest terms.
(e) all rational numbers greater than -2 with denominator a power of 2 when written in lowest terms."," We can use $S$ to make any positive integer. Then we can use $T$ on that positive integer to make any positive rational number with denominator a power of 2 . Or we can apply $T$ first, and repeatedly applying $T$ gives numbers down to -2 (almost). This is only consistent with option (e).

7,H,"A sequence $a_{n}$ is defined by $a_{0}=A$ and $a_{k}=\left(a_{k-1}\right)^{2}$ for $k>0$, where $A>1$. The sequence $b_{n}$ is defined by $b_{n}=\log _{2} a_{n}$. The sequence $b_{n}$ is

(a) constant
(b) an arithmetic progression
(c) a geometric progression
(d) all of the above
(e) none of the above"," $a_{n}=A^{2^{n}}$ so $b_{n}=2^{n} \log _{2} A$ which is a geometric progression, but not an arithmetic progression or a constant, because $\log _{2} A>0$.

8,I,"An equilateral triangle is drawn in the $x y$-plane. Two of its vertices are at $(0,0)$ and $(1000,0)$. The number of points $(x, y)$ inside the triangle, where $x$ and $y$ are both whole numbers, equals\\

(b) 866,026 ,\\
(c) 866,027 ,\\
(d) 432,512 ,\\
(e) 432,513 .
[Note that $\sqrt{3}=1.7321$ to 4 decimal places.]"," The other vertex of the triangle is at $(500,500 \sqrt{3})$ and the points inside are either in $x<500$, $x>500$, or down the middle $x=500$. Now $866<500 \sqrt{3}<867$ so there are 866 points down the middle. The total is therefore even. Imagine the parallelogram made by adding a triangle with vertices at $(1000,0)$ and $(500,500 \sqrt{3})$. There are approximately 866,000 points contained in these two triangles (866 rows of about 1000), so about 433,00 in each triangle. Only one option is both even and approximately 433,000.

The answer is $(\mathrm{d})$
$\mathbf{J}$ The region has reflectional symmetry in the $x$ axis and in the $y$-axis, so consider first the region in the quadrant where $x>0$ and $y>0$. In that region, the region is bounded by the parabolas $y=2-x^{2}$ from the second inequality, and $x=2-y^{2}$ from the last inequality. These parabolas meet at $(1,1)$. There is a line of symmetry in the line $y=x$, so we just need to find the area under the line $y=x$ between 0 and 1 (a triangle) and the area under the parabola $y=2-x^{2}$ between 1 and $\sqrt{2}$. Then we'll multiply this area by 8 .\\

So we have
$$
8\left(\frac{1}{2}+\int_{1}^{\sqrt{2}} 2-x^{2} \mathrm{~d} x\right)=8\left(\frac{1}{2}+\left[2 x-\frac{x^{3}}{3}\right]_{1}^{\sqrt{2}}\right)=8\left(\frac{4}{3} \sqrt{2}-\frac{5}{3}+\frac{1}{2}\right)=\frac{4}{3}(8 \sqrt{2}-7)
