$\mathbf{J}$ If the line is normal to the cubic in two places then the gradient of the cubic is equal at those two points. By symmetry of the derivative of the cubic, these points must be $\pm a$ for some real $a$. Then by rotational symmetry of the graph of the cubic, the normal line must go through the origin. So we must find values of $m$ such that $y=m x$ is normal to the given curve at some point.
The points of intersection are at $x= \pm \sqrt{k+m}$. The tangent should be normal to the line $y=m x$, so $\left(3 x^{2}-k\right) m=-1$ at either of those points of intersection. This simplifies to $(3 m+2 k) m=-1$. This is a quadratic with solutions if and only if $k^{2} \geq 3$. But we need to make sure that the points of intersection at $x= \pm \sqrt{k+m}$ actually exist.
The roots of the quadratic are $m=\frac{1}{3}\left(-k \pm \sqrt{k^{2}-3}\right)$. If $k>0$ then the larger root clearly gives $k+m>0$. However if $k<0$ then for $k+m>0$, we would need $2 k+\sqrt{k^{2}-3}>0$ which would imply that $4 k^{2}<k^{2}-3$, which is impossible. So only the case $k \geq \sqrt{3}$ gives a line that's normal to the cubic with a real point of intersection.

The intersection points between the inner circle and those lines are $(\sqrt{3} / 2,1 / 2)$ and reflections, so the acute angle subtended at the origin by the two lines is $60^{\circ}$. We would therefore like one-third of the area between the two circles, which is $\frac{1}{3} \pi\left(2^{2}-1^{2}\right)=\pi$.
The answer is (b)
$\mathbf{E}$ The centre of the circle is $\left(\frac{p}{2}, \frac{q+1}{2}\right)$ and the radius is $\sqrt{\frac{p^{2}}{4}+\frac{(q-1)^{2}}{4}}$, so the equation of the circle is

(c) $y=(2)^{4 / 3} f(x)$,
(d) $y=(2)^{-3} f(x)$,
(e) $y=(2)^{4} f(x)$."," Clearly $f$ is always a positive whole integer from the recursion relations.

First find $n$ with $f(n)=1$. Because $f(2 n)=f(n)$ and $f(1)=1$, it must be the case that for all powers of $2, f(n)=1$. On the other hand, $f(2 n+1)=f(n)+f(n+1)$ is definitely at least two, so $f(n)$ is only equal to 1 on the powers of 2 .
Next consider values of $n$ for which $f(n)=2$. The first equation shows us that if we have $n$ even and $f(n)=2$ then $f(n / 2)=2$. Let's suppose instead that $n$ is odd and write $n=2 m+1$. Then we would have $f(n)=f(m)+f(m+1)$. The only way for this to be 2 is if the right-hand side is $1+1$, which only happens if both the consecutive numbers $m, m+1$ are powers of 2 , which only happens for 1,2 . Check that $f(3)=f(1)+f(2)=2$. So the points where $f(n)=2$ are precisely those where $n$ is three times a power of 2 (they're of the form $3 \times 2^{k}$ ).
Now finally consider values of $n$ for which $f(n)=3$. The first equation again tells us that we can multiply any such $n$ by 2 . Let's look for odd solutions. They must come from $1+2$ on the right-hand side of the second equation, which only happens if a power of $2\left(2^{l}\right.$ say) is one more or one less than a number of the form $3 \times 2^{k}$. That's a bit unusual though, because both $2^{l}$\\
and $3 \times 2^{k}$ are even, unless one of the powers of 2 is equal to 1 . So those consecutive numbers must be either 2 and 3 or they could be 3 and 4 . This gives $f(5)=3$ and $f(7)=3$, but that's it for odd numbers. The solutions to $f(n)=3$ are therefore $5 \times 2^{k}$ or $7 \times 2^{k}$. None of these are multiples of 35 .
